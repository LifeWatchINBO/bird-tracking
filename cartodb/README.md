# Accessing the bird tracking data with CartoDB

## Introduction

All our public bird tracking data are available through [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), an open source tool to visualize and analyze geospatial data on the web. CartoDB allows users to query the data using SQL via the [CartoDB API](http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/sql-api.html) or download these in various formats (`csv`, `shp`, `kml`, `svg`, and `geosjon`). The data are made available as two tables: `bird_tracking` and `bird_tracking_devices` (see further).

## Tracked species

We are currently tracking 3 species over 2 projects:

vernacular name | scientific name | family | project shortname | published dataset
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[Lesser Black-backed Gull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Black-backed_Gull) | Larus fuscus | Laridae | `gull` | 
[European Herring Gull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Herring_Gull) | Larus argentatus | Laridae | `gull` | 
[Western Marsh Harrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Marsh_Harrier) | Circus aeruginosus | Accipitridae | `wmh |

## bird_tracking table

This table contains all public occurrences recorded by the GPS tags. The data are imported every 6 months or so from the `uva_tracking_limited` table in the [UvA-BiTS virtual lab](http://www.uva-bits.nl/virtual-lab/). Test records are removed and outliers flagged (see [import procedure](import-procedure.md)).

### Public access

* Table page: https://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/tables/bird_tracking/public
* SQL API: http://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20bird_tracking%20LIMIT%20100

### Fields

field name | type | description
--- | --- | ---
cartodb_id | number | ID generated by CartoDB on record creation.
the_geom | geometry | Point (geometry) of the occurrence, generated by CartoDB from `longitude` and `latitude` on record creation.
the_geom_webmercator | geometry | Hidden field, generated by CartoDB from `the_geom` on record alteration, but with webmercator datum. Used to draw points on the map.
altitude | number | Altitude recorded by the GPS tag.
date_time | date | UTC timestamp recorded by the GPS tag.
device_info_serial | number | ID of the GPS tag and foreign key to `bird_tracking_devices` table.
gps_fixtime | string | 
h_accuracy | string | 
latitude | number | WGS84 latitude recorded by the GPS tag.
location | string | 
longitude | number | WGS84 longitude recorded by the GPS tag.
positiondop | string | 
pressure | string | 
satellites_used | string | 
speed_accuracy | string | 
temperature | string | 
userflag | boolean | `True` for outliers, which are automatically flagged on import (see [import procedure](import-procedure.md)).
v_accuracy | string | 
x_speed | string | 
y_speed | string | 
z_speed | string | 
created_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record creation.
updated_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record alteration.

## bird_tracking_devices table

This manually maintained reference table contains information on the GPS tags and the individual birds these are mounted on. Thus far, there is a one-one relationship between device and bird.

### Public access

* Table page: https://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/tables/bird_tracking_devices/public
* SQL API: http://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20bird_tracking_devices

### Fields

field name | type | description
--- | --- | ---
cartodb_id | number | ID generated by CartoDB on record creation.
the_geom | geometry | Point (geometry) of the estimated tagging position, generated by CartoDB from `tracking_start_longitude` and `tracking_start_latitude` on record creation.
the_geom_webmercator | geometry | Hidden field, generated by CartoDB from `the_geom` on record alteration, but with webmercator datum. Used to draw points on the map.
bird_name | string | Name given to individual bird by the researcher.
dead | boolean | `True` if individual bird is confirmed or likely dead.
device_info_serial | number | ID of the GPS tag. Used to link with `bird_tracking` table
project_leader | string | Project leader of the research project for which this tags are used.
project_shortname | string | Shortname for the research project for which these tags are used.
remarks | string | Remarks by the researcher regarding the tag or bird.
ring_code | string | Code of the metal leg ring on the individual bird.
ring_code_color | string | Code of the coloured leg ring on the individual bird.
scientific_name | string | Species name of the individual bird.
sex | string | Sex of the individual bird.
tracking_end_date_time | date | UTC timestamp for when tracking is no longer (considered) operational.
tracking_start_date_time | date | UTC timestamp for when tracking is (considered) operational (= somewhat later than tagging). Used to exclude pre-tracking test records during import.
tracking_start_latitude | number | WGS84 latitude of the estimated tagging position.
tracking_start_location_name | string | Name of area where the bird was tagged. Gulls are tagged on nest, so this is can be considered their colony location. Harriers are tagged near their nest, so this can be considered their home range for at least the first year.
tracking_start_longitude | number | WGS84 longitude of the estimated tagging position.
tracking_start_weight_in_g | number | Weight of the individual bird in grams when tagged.
created_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record creation.
updated_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record alteration.
