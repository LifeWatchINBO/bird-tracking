# Accessing the bird tracking data with CartoDB

## Introduction

The best way to access our bird tracking data is via our standardized, documented, published, and [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org)-registered Darwin Core Archive:

Bird tracking - GPS tracking of Lesser Black-backed Gull and Herring Gull breeding at the Belgian coast | [INBO IPT](http://dataset.inbo.be/bird-tracking-gull-occurrences) | [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/83e20573-f7dd-4852-9159-21566e1e691e) | [GitHub](https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/bird-tracking-gull-occurrences/)

But for those who prefer, we have also made our public bird tracking data available through [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), an open source tool to visualize and analyze geospatial data on the web. CartoDB allows users to query the data using SQL via the [CartoDB API](http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/sql-api.html) or download these in various formats (`csv`, `shp`, `kml`, `svg`, and `geosjon`). The data are made available as two tables: `bird_tracking` and `bird_tracking_devices`. We also released a small sample dataset `tracking_eric`, containing 2 months of tracking data from one individual.

## Tracked species

We are currently tracking 3 species over 2 projects:

vernacular name | scientific name | family | species code | published dataset
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[Lesser Black-backed Gull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Black-backed_Gull) | Larus fuscus | Laridae | `lbbg` | [bird-tracking-gull-occurrences](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/83e20573-f7dd-4852-9159-21566e1e691e)
[Herring Gull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Herring_Gull) | Larus argentatus | Laridae | `hg` | [bird-tracking-gull-occurrences](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/83e20573-f7dd-4852-9159-21566e1e691e)
[Western Marsh Harrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Marsh_Harrier) | Circus aeruginosus | Accipitridae | `wmh` |

## tracking_eric table

This table contains two months of tracking data from one individual: Lesser Black-backed Gull Eric. As the dataset only contains 25,483 records and a limited number of fields, it is a good test dataset. We visualized these data and explained how we did it in [this blog post](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog/posts/tracking-eric.html). All Eric's data are included in the overall `bird_tracking` table.

### Public access

* Table page: https://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/tables/tracking_eric/public
* SQL API: http://lifewatch-inbo.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20tracking_eric%20LIMIT%20100

### Fields

field name | type | description
--- | --- | ---
cartodb_id | number | ID generated by CartoDB on record creation.
the_geom | geometry | Point (geometry) of the occurrence, generated by CartoDB from `longitude` and `latitude` on record creation.
the_geom_webmercator | geometry | Hidden field, generated by CartoDB from `the_geom` on record alteration, but with webmercator datum. Used to draw points on the map.
date_time | date | UTC timestamp recorded by the GPS tracker.
day_of_year | number | The day of the year of `date_time`.
duration_in_seconds | number | Number of seconds between this and the previous occurrence. The calculation is explained in [this blog post](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog/posts/tracking-eric.html).
distance_in_meters |number | Distance in meters between this and the previous occurrence.
created_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record creation.
updated_at | date | UTC timestamp generated by CartoDB on record alteration.

## bird_tracking table

This table contains all public occurrences recorded by the GPS trackers. The data are imported every 6 months or so from the `uva_tracking_limited` table in the [UvA-BiTS virtual lab](http://www.uva-bits.nl/virtual-lab/). Test records are removed and outliers flagged (see [import procedure](import-procedure.md)).

## bird_tracking_devices table

This manually maintained reference table contains information on the GPS trackers and the individual birds these are mounted on. Thus far, there is a one-one relationship between device and bird.
